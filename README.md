# Our-Wedding-Website


# Ideas
1. Add a small countdown of days until the wedding
1. Our RSVP cards should allow for guests to rsvp online OR mailin if they want
	- for online, card will list a code to fill a form field out for validation purposes
	- for return, just list adress on card per usual
	- large RSVP card as the footer?
